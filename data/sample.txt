LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
It enables applications that:
- Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
- Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

This simple RAG project demonstrates how to use LangChain with Ollama and ChromaDB.
ChromaDB is a vector database that stores embeddings of your data.
Ollama allows you to run open-source large language models, such as Llama 3, locally.
